# Maze-RL
A custom maze environment given to a Reinforcement Learning Model to find optimal paths through Q learning with Cross-entropy method.

You can open the files using jupyter notebook

You can change the Matrix in 'maze_env.ipynb' file and run the 'reinforcement learning.ipynb' to see the model converging to the optimal path from the graphs displayed.
